First Minister Humza Yousaf has said the Scottish government will "in essence replicate" UK laws banning XL bully dogs without a licence.  The Scottish government has faced calls to fall in line with restrictions on the breed south of the border.  Amid rising concerns over attacks, the UK government banned the breed in England and Wales. The Scottish government has accepted there has been an influx of XL bullies to Scotland since the UK's new law.  Mr Yousaf said the UK government's measures were "not a ban" and were announced without consultation with the Scottish government.
